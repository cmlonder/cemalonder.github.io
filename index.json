Overview Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is used to send data between applications in real-time. It is good to have an overview of some Kafka terminology before going further;\nTopic: Messages are published to\nProducer: An application who can publish its messages to a topic\nConsumer: An application that can consume messages from its subscribed topic. Most simply, a producer writes messages to topics, and consumers can read messages from its subscribed topics. This allows applications to communicate asynchronously and fulfill high payloads.\nIn this tutorial we are going to create a game announcement system;\nTopic: Games\nProducer: /games/score/?name=${playerName} endpoint where we are going to call with curl request when a A new score is made in our virtual football game.\nConsumer: There will be 2 consumers. Radio and TV. They will consume our message and use it their business logic. This will show us how we can get the benefit of the publisher/subscriber system.\n2. Application Setup We need to prepare our environment by running Apache Kafka and its dependency on ZooKeeper. Kafka provides a simple ZooKeeper server for local purposes, but in production, it should be configured separately. Let\u0026rsquo;s stick with basics in our tutorial:\n Download Apache Kafka here Untar it:  tar -xzf kafka_2.12-2.5.0.tgz\rcd kafka_2.12-2.5.0\r 2.1. Start ZooKeeper Server Kafka uses the ZooKeeper server to manage its topics. Start it:\nLinux\n./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties\r Windows\n.\\bin\\windows\\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\\config\\zookeeper.properties\r 2.2. Start Kafka Server Start kafka server after ZooKeeper is up \u0026amp; ready:\nLinux\n./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties\r Windows\n.\\bin\\windows\\kafka-server-start.bat .\\config\\server.properties\r 2.3. Create a topic For simplicity, we are going to create a topic before our application is started. Create games topic with the following:\nLinux\n.\\bin \\kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic scores\r Windows\n.\\bin\\windows\\kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic scores\r 2.4. List topics List topics in the Kafka, we will see scores topic is created.\nLinux\n.\\bin\\kafka-topics.bat –list –bootstrap-server localhost:9092\r Windows\n.\\bin\\windows\\kafka-topics.bat --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092\r 2.5. Create the Project Now we can start creating our application. We need the following dependencies:\nspring-boot-starter: Provides our core Spring libraries.\nspring-boot-starter-web: We need it to provide a simple web server and REST operations\nspring-kafka: Wraps Kafka to abstract messaging operations\nspring-boot-starter-test: For core test libraries\nspring-kafka-test: provides testing utils for Kafka\nOur final pom.xml:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026quot;1.0\u0026quot; encoding=\u0026quot;UTF-8\u0026quot;?\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;project xmlns=\u0026quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\u0026quot; xmlns:xsi=\u0026quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\u0026quot;\rxsi:schemaLocation=\u0026quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;modelVersion\u0026gt;4.0.0\u0026lt;/modelVersion\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;parent\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-parent\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;2.2.6.RELEASE\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;relativePath/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/parent\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.cemalonder.tutorials\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-kafka-tutorial\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;spring-boot-kafka-tutorial\u0026lt;/name\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;Spring Boot kafka integration tutorial\u0026lt;/description\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;properties\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;java.version\u0026gt;1.8\u0026lt;/java.version\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/properties\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dependencies\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-web\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.kafka\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-kafka\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-test\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;scope\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/scope\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;exclusions\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;exclusion\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.junit.vintage\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;junit-vintage-engine\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/exclusion\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/exclusions\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.kafka\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-kafka-test\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;scope\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/scope\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/dependencies\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;build\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;plugins\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/plugins\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/build\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/project\u0026gt;\r Or you can also use Spring Initializr to generate above pom.xml quickly with the following selections: 3. Application Configuration We need to configure our application.yml/properties with the following:\nBy default, our Kafka server started on port 9092 when we run in our terminal. We will use the default port and Serializer/Deserializer provided by Kafka. We configure our application to run on port 9000 and as the last step we give a group-id as a default group-id but we will change it per Consumer in the following steps.\nserver:\rport: 9000\rspring:\rkafka:\rconsumer:\rbootstrap-servers: localhost:9092\rgroup-id: group-id\rkey-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer\rvalue-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer\rproducer:\rbootstrap-servers: localhost:9092\rkey-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer\rvalue-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer\r 4. Create a Controller We provide /games/score endpoint with the name request param. This controller then delegates its job to Scores class with incoming name.\n@RestController\r@RequestMapping(value = \u0026quot;/games\u0026quot;)\rpublic class GameController {\rprivate final Scores scores;\r@Autowired\rpublic GameController(Scores scores) {\rthis.scores = scores;\r}\r@PostMapping(value = \u0026quot;/score\u0026quot;)\rpublic void makeAnnouncement(@RequestParam(\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;) String name) {\rthis.scores.sendMessage(name);\r}\r}\r 5. Create a Producer Create producer package and Scores file inside it as following:\n@Service\rpublic class Scores {\rprivate final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Scores.class);\rprivate static final String TOPIC = \u0026quot;scores\u0026quot;;\rprivate final KafkaTemplate\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; kafkaTemplate;\r@Autowired\rpublic Scores(KafkaTemplate\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; kafkaTemplate) {\rthis.kafkaTemplate = kafkaTemplate;\r}\rpublic void sendMessage(String name) {\rlogger.info(\u0026quot;Publishing message to {} topic\u0026quot;, TOPIC);\rthis.kafkaTemplate.send(TOPIC, name + \u0026quot; is scored a new goal!\u0026quot;);\r}\r}\r This class is annotated with Service annotation and it\u0026rsquo;s now inside Spring Context. We are using KafkaTemplate to easily send messages to the given topic, since our class is already in Spring Context we can use Autowired annotation in our constructor and inject KafkaTemplate to our class. Then we are calling KafkaTemplate’s send method with the score topic we already created and message for the topic.\n6. Create Consumers We will create two Consumers for the score topic. First, create consumers package and TvConsumer class in it as follows:\n6.1. First Consumer: TV This class is annotated with Service annotation and its now inside Spring Context similar to the provider above. We are using KafkaListener annotation provided by spring-kafka to listen given topic. It is listening to players\u0026rsquo; topics with its unique groupId which is the tv in this case. By giving different groupId’s, multiple consumers can listen to the same topic. In the end, the TvConsumer class logs a simple message that shows it is handled by the TV.\n@Service\rpublic class TvConsumer {\rprivate final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TvConsumer.class);\rprivate Integer score = 0;\r@KafkaListener(topics = \u0026quot;scores\u0026quot;, groupId = \u0026quot;tv\u0026quot;)\rpublic void consume(String message) {\rlogger.info(\u0026quot;{}. This is outstanding to watch on TV. Score now {} - 0!\u0026quot;, message, ++score);\r}\r}\r 6.2. Second Consumer: Radio Similar to the TvConsumer, RadioConsumer listens to players\u0026rsquo; topic with its groupId and logs its special message.\n@Service\rpublic class RadioConsumer {\rprivate final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RadioConsumer.class);\rprivate Integer score = 0;\r@KafkaListener(topics = \u0026quot;scores\u0026quot;, groupId = \u0026quot;radio\u0026quot;)\rpublic void consume(String message) {\rlogger.info(\u0026quot;{}. Score is now {}-0 for the people who just turned on their Radios!\u0026quot;, message,\r++score);\r}\r}\r 7. Send a Message To Topic Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to send a message to the topic using basic curl:\ncurl -X POST localhost:9000/games/score?name=\u0026quot;Ronaldo\u0026quot;\r And let\u0026rsquo;s see the results in our console:\nc.c.t.s.producer.Scores: Publishing message to scores topic\rc.c.t.s.consumer.RadioConsumer: Ronaldo is scored a new goal!. Score is now 1-0 for the people who c.c.t.s.consumer.TvConsumer: Ronaldo is scored a new goal!. This is outstanding to watch on TV. Score now 1 - 0!\r 8. Summary In this post, we created kafka topic, send messages via a producer and retrieve them via multiple consumers from same topic using Spring Boot Kafka libraries.\nYou can find source code of this project in Github\n","date":1594937498,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594937498,"objectID":"46146319801dc1a428a003bd95dd1d1b","permalink":"http://cemalonder.com/post/spring-boot-kafka-tutorial/","publishdate":"2020-07-17T01:11:38+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/spring-boot-kafka-tutorial/","section":"post","summary":"Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is used to send data between applications in real-time.

Overview Sometimes it is very beneficial to have your own Jenkins:\n You have a ready Jenkins in your company but you are just learning Jenkins and you are pushing every little change to the repository which makes them dirty You don\u0026rsquo;t have a ready Jenkins and want to give it a try  Jenkins works with repositories which makes it a great tool for CI \u0026amp; CD. Communication between Jenkins and the repository manager is bi-directional, where the repository manager (Github in our case) pushes changes to Jenkins and Jenkins also fetches the repo from Github. So if you want to give it a try, Github must be able to access it. But it is not possible while you are using Jenkins locally since Github can not access your localhost:8080. So you should install a Jenkins to a server you own where this is not always possible.\nIn this article, we are going to set up everything from scratch with a basic \u0026amp; quick way and we will integrate Github with locally running Jenkins.\n2. Install Jenkins with Docker Docker is the easiest way to start using Jenkins. Here are the steps for downloading the docker image, starting a new container and setting up Jenkins:\n1. Start local Jenkins by running following command:\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts\r This creates a Jenkins on port 8080 with a volume jenkins_home managed by docker. It is not suggested by Jenkins to map the volume to the host, so we will keep the volume in this way.\n2. There is an initial administrator password in our terminal when we run above command:\nCopy this password then go to localhost:8080. Enter password here and continue:\n3. Select install suggested plugins and wait for the installation process finish. This will install plugins like Git, SVN, etc. where we are going to use it in the next steps.\n4. Optionally let\u0026rsquo;s also create an admin user to later use instead of initial admin.\n5. Finish the installation by applying the default URL since we will keep using localhost.\n3. Create a Project in Github You may already have a project, for the tutorial purpose let\u0026rsquo;s also create a new fresh project Github-integration-with-local-jenkins which is located here\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s add a simple Jenkinsfile to the root of the project which simply echos Hello World\npipeline {\ragent any\rstages {\rstage('Hello') {\rsteps {\recho 'Hello World'\r}\r}\r}\r}\r 4. Create an Access Token in Github Jenkins will try to reach Github for a bunch of operations where it will need some access token. Let\u0026rsquo;s create this token:\n1. Click on your profile icon then select Settings from the dropdown then select Developer Settings from the left navigation panel\n2. Select Personal access tokens and click on Generate new token 3. Now we should select the scopes of our token. repo and admin:repo_hook scopes are enough for our operations. Select them, give them a note, and generate the token.\n4. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to TAKE NOT of this generated token since you will not able to see it again.\nNow we are ready to create a job in Jenkins. We will use this token while configuring Github in the Jenkins.\n5. Configure Github Server in Jenkins Before creating a new job, let\u0026rsquo;s add the token we generated in Github to our Jenkins.\n1. Go to Jenkins Home and click on Manage Jenkins then select Configure System\n2. Scroll down to the Github section. Click on Add Github Server then give it a name like github api. Check Manage hooks. We need to enter our credentials for Github. We will use the token we generated in the previous step. Click on Add and select Jenkins 3. Now you see a popup to add a credential. Select Global credentials and Secret text. Enter your generated access token which you created in the previous step from Github. Finally, enter a description ( github access token in this case) and add it.\n4. As the last step, select the credential you created (github access token) in the popup and click on Test connection. A response should appear on the screen which shows remaining API limits for your user. See here for Github API rate limit information, but it is enough for learning purposes.\nWe successfully added a credential to access Github APIs. Let\u0026rsquo;s continue with creating a new job.\n6. Create a New Job We need to create a job in Jenkins by setting up our project URL and giving Github access so that Jenkins can fetch our project to build it within our pipeline. Let\u0026rsquo;s set it up step by step\n1. Click on create a new item 2. Select Pipeline and give it a name here.\n3. Now we should configure our job. Click (or scroll) to Build Triggers section and check Github hook trigger for GITScm polling.\n4. Click on Pipeline and select Pipeline script from SCM from Definition dropdown. This configures Jenkins job that we will use instructions from our project\u0026rsquo;s Jenkinsfile to run the pipeline. Enter your \u0026hellip;git repository URL.\n7. Expose Your Localhost with NGROK As mentioned at the beginning of the article, we need a way to Github to communicate with our local running Jenkins. There is a way for it; exposing your local with a tunnel to the web. NGROK is the easiest way for this which makes it available with a simple command. But it SHOULD NOT be used for production purposes.\nFirst download ngrok for your operating system here\nThen type the following command in your terminal (if you did not add ngrok to PATH, cd into your ngrok download directory);\nngrok http 8080\r This exposes your 8080 which is the port Jenkins is running on to the web via ngrok. After you type it, you should see the exposed URL like following in your terminal:\nCopy the Http forwarding URL and paste it to your browser, you will be redirected to your local Jenkins server. We are ready to go to the next step, configuring Github for webhooks with Jenkins.\n8. Configure Webhook URL for your Project in Github Go to your project page and click on Settings tab. Then click Webhooks from the left navigation panel and click on Add webhook. Now you should see the following screen:\nFor the Payload URL you should add your ngrok URL from previous step + /github-webhook/ which will be ${YOUR_NGROK_URL}/github-webhook/. So my ngrok URL is: http://d9cdfa47e311.ngrok.io then my Payload URL is http://d9cdfa47e311.ngrok.io/github-webhook/ Trailing Slash / at the end is imported which may cause redirection problem if you don\u0026rsquo;t add. (Also you can\u0026rsquo;t trigger this URL in the browser since /github-webhook provided by Jenkins for POST requests)\nSelect application/json as content type and pick Just the push event. This configures when to call Jenkins if you want to configure detailed hooks, select Let me select individual events and then you can pick the events like Pull Requests, Pushes, Releases etc. to trigger calling your Jenkins endpoint.\nFinally, add the webhook.\n9. Push changes to Github to Trigger Local Jenkins Pipeline Before triggering the job via push to Github, I had to trigger it once manually otherwise pipeline is not triggered. I could not find a description for it but I guess plugin checks the local difference of the repository with the changes it received but it needs an initial pull of the repo to the local. So first build it manually once:\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add a small change to the repo and push it. I changed my echo message from Hello World to Hello World from localhost and pushed it to my repo.\nAnd 2nd build is automatically triggered!\nAnd if you click on the build details (#2 in the above screen) and then click Console Output you can see the build details. Here are the important parts of log in my console;\n it shows that pipeline is started by a push to the repository with the commit message hello from localhost and runs the Jenkinsfile in the repository by showing Hello World from localhost  Started by GitHub push by cmlonder\r.... SOME MORE MESSAGE REGARDING GITHUB CHANGES ....\rCommit message: \u0026quot;hello from localhost\u0026quot;\r.... SOME MORE MESSAGE REGARDING GITHUB CHANGES ....\rHello World from localhost\r[Pipeline] }\r[Pipeline] // stage\r[Pipeline] }\r[Pipeline] // withEnv\r[Pipeline] }\r[Pipeline] // node\r[Pipeline] End of Pipeline\rFinished: SUCCESS\r 10. Summary In this post, we made the integration of local Jenkins using Docker containers to the Github. Also, we saw how to create a job, add a Github credential, configure your pipeline with Jenkinsfile, add a webhook from your repository to your Jenkins.\nYou can find source code of this project in Github\n11.

Create a Simple Todo App Let\u0026rsquo;s first create an empty project and initialize go modules.\nmkdir go-dockerized-coverage\rcd go-dockerized-coverage\rgo mod init cemalonder.com/go/todo\r Create a todo folder and todo.go file\nmkdir todo\rtouch todo.go\r And write a simple Todo App with 2 functions; Add and Complete.\n// Package todo provides a simple todo application\rpackage todo\rimport \u0026quot;errors\u0026quot;\r// Todo representation of todo with id, title and completed status\rtype Todo struct {\rId int\rTitle string\rCompleted bool\r}\r// TodoApp holds todo list and id counter\rtype TodoApp struct {\rtodos map[int]Todo\rid int\r}\r// CreateTodoApp creates a new TodoApp by initializing todo list and id counter\rfunc CreateTodoApp() TodoApp {\rtodoApp := TodoApp{}\rtodoApp.todos = make(map[int]Todo)\rtodoApp.id = 0\rreturn todoApp\r}\r// Add adds a new todo with given title and returns created todo with a new id\rfunc (app *TodoApp) Add(title string) Todo {\rapp.id = app.id + 1\rapp.todos[app.id] = Todo{app.id, title, false}\rreturn app.todos[app.id]\r}\r// Complete completes a todo with given id and\r// returns todo not found exception if todo with given id is not found\rfunc (app *TodoApp) Complete(id int) error {\rif todo, ok := app.todos[id]; ok {\rtodo.Completed = true\rapp.todos[id] = todo\rreturn nil\r} else {\rreturn errors.New(\u0026quot;todo not found\u0026quot;)\r}\r}\r 2. Write Unit Tests Now let\u0026rsquo;s create some unit tests for our Todo App. My Complete function contains some business logic which I can write unit tests. I will consider business cases first, then implement them;\n When I complete a todo which exists, I expect it\u0026rsquo;s completed state is true When I complete a todo which does not exist, I expect an error  package todo_test\rimport (\r\u0026quot;testing\u0026quot;\r)\rfunc TestCompleteForFoundTodo(t *testing.T) {\rapp := CreateTodoApp()\rtodo := app.Add(\u0026quot;Wake up early\u0026quot;)\rif todo.Completed {\rt.Error(\u0026quot;Expected completed is false, but it is true\u0026quot;)\r}\rerr := app.Complete(todo.Id)\rif err != nil {\rt.Errorf(\u0026quot;Expected error is nil, but it is %v\u0026quot;, err)\r}\rif todo.Completed {\rt.Error(\u0026quot;Expected completed is true, but it is false\u0026quot;)\r}\r}\rfunc TestCompleteForNotFoundTodo(t *testing.T) {\rapp := CreateTodoApp()\rerr := app.Complete(1)\rif err == nil {\rt.Errorf(\u0026quot;Expected error is not nil, but it is %v\u0026quot;, err)\r}\r}\r I\u0026rsquo;m following some testing conventions above which starts with TestXxx(*testing.T). And also my package name is todo_test. Since this post is about integrating Go with Sonar I will let keep them for another post, let\u0026rsquo;s continue with generating code coverage.\n3. Generate Code Coverage Let\u0026rsquo;s run and generate coverage for our project:\ngo test ./... -v -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=count -coverpkg=./...\r And if summarize what is above command and its flag is doing:\n go test ./\u0026hellip; = running all the tests in current and all sub-folders -v = print full output -coverprofile=coverage.out = write coverage to the given file, here we write to coverage.out -covermode=count = Sets the mode for coverage analyses, here we set to count which shows how many times statements are run -coverpkg=./\u0026hellip; = apply coverage for all matching pattern, here we applied current and all sub-folders  For the detailed list of all flags for go test command, see here\nNow we have a coverage.out generated in the root of the project content like this:\n mode: count\rcemalonder.com/go/todo/main.go:3.14,4.2 0 0\rcemalonder.com/go/todo/todo/todo.go:20.30,25.2 4 2\rcemalonder.com/go/todo/todo/todo.go:28.44,32.2 3 1\rcemalonder.com/go/todo/todo/todo.go:36.44,37.35 1 2\rcemalonder.com/go/todo/todo/todo.go:37.35,41.3 3 1\rcemalonder.com/go/todo/todo/todo.go:41.8,43.3 1 1\r The next step is sending this coverage to Sonar so we can visualize it.\n4. Start Local SonarQube Even you will send your reports to a Sonar instance which you have in your company\u0026rsquo;s server, let\u0026rsquo;s try everything first locally. It will be pretty easy using Docker.\nStart a new SonarQube container:\ndocker run --rm -p 9000:9000 sonarqube\r If we summarize above command;\n Installs sonarqube image if it does not exist locally Creates a container from this image Starts this container Forwards internal 9000 port of docker to host (localhost in this case) so you can access it via [localhost:9000] Removes container (\u0026ndash;rm) when it is stopped so you don\u0026rsquo;t run out of space (you still have the image)  Now we have a locally running sonarqube with no persistency (in-memory), so you will lose your pushed reports when you restart your container but it is okay for our case since we want to test our reports.\nIf you visit localhost:9000 in your browser you will see local SonarQube instance with 0 projects.\nWe need to push our project to SonarQube. Let\u0026rsquo;s continue with the next step.\n5. Configure Sonar in Project We need some configuration in our project before we push it to the SonarQube. In the next step, we will be using SonarScanner which requires sonar-project.properties configured in the project. By default, it should be located at the root of the project. Let\u0026rsquo;s create sonar-project.properties in the root of the project and\ntouch sonar-project.properties\r And its content is:\nsonar.language=go\r# This should be unique in SonarQube\rsonar.projectKey=simple-todo-app\rsonar.projectName=Simple Todo Application\rsonar.go.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.out\rsonar.exclusions=**/*_test.go\r And if we summarize the properties used above:\n sonar.language = we are setting our language but SonarQube also capable of guessing it sonar.projectKey = this should be unique in your SonarQube instance sonar.projectName = this will be shown in the UI as a name of our project sonar.go.coverage.reportPaths = we show our coverage.out which we generated in write unit tests step sonar.exclusions = we are excluding _test.go files since we don\u0026rsquo;t want to get coverage of tests itself All of the properties can be found here.  We have configured our project. The last step is pushing these to the SonarQube instance.\n6. Send Coverage Report to SonarQube using SonarScanner \rSonarScanner is a tool used to run code analysis on SonarQube instance. To use this we should install it locally and run against our project which has code coverage generated and sonar-project.properties configured. But instead of installing locally, I would like to do this step also with Docker since SonarQube officially provides a docker image for this.\nBefore running the sonar-scanner-cli docker command you should get your local IP since we will need it in the next step. For this type ipconfig if you are working in Windows or ifconfig if you are in a Linux based Operating System. Then take note of your IPv4 Adress for the valid Adapter, in my case I\u0026rsquo;m working via Wireless so I take note of my Wireless Lan adapter Wi-Fi which is 192.168.0.11 as follows\nNow run following command in the shell (run it in PowerShell if you are in windows otherwise ${PWD} does not work)\n docker run --rm -e SONAR_HOST_URL=http://192.168.0.11:9000 -v ${PWD}:/usr/src sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli\r And if we summarize above command:\n Installs sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli image if it does not exist locally Creates a container from this image Starts this container Sets SONAR_HOST_URL environment variable to show where SonarQube runs Creates a volume from /usr/src to your local (${PWD} or give your absolute path like /c/yourUser/yourProject) so sonar-scanner-cli can use your local project and its properties (sonar-project.properties) Removes container (\u0026ndash;rm) when it is stopped so you don\u0026rsquo;t run out of space (you still have the image)  In your terminal you should see an EXECUTION SUCCESS message with a log similar to this:\n...More logs...\rINFO: Analysis report generated in 134ms, dir size=80 KB\rINFO: Analysis report compressed in 681ms, zip size=12 KB\rINFO: Analysis report uploaded in 260ms\rINFO: ANALYSIS SUCCESSFUL, you can browse http://192.168.0.11:9000/dashboard?id=simple-todo-app\rINFO: Note that you will be able to access the updated dashboard once the server has processed the submitted analysis report\rINFO: More about the report processing at http://192.168.0.11:9000/api/ce/task?id=AXNFIP_bMJij3EBEF7zK\rINFO: Analysis total time: 5.375 s\rINFO: ------------------------------------------------------------------------\rINFO: EXECUTION SUCCESS\rINFO: ------------------------------------------------------------------------\rINFO: Total time: 12.923s\rINFO: Final Memory: 13M/47M\rINFO: ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r NOTE: You can not use http://localhost:9000 instead of http://192.168.0.11:9000 since sonar-scanner-cli Docker container runs on its host and localhost for that container is not same address with localhost of yours (at least in Windows, Mac\u0026rsquo;s docker daemon may be editing etc/hosts files so users in Mac MAY be using localhost even they are working in Docker)\nNow if you visit http://localhost:9000 again, you will see there is 1 project now. Click on that and here is our report:\nSince Sonar has default Quality Gates configured, I\u0026rsquo;m now passing all of the scores and we have Passed status.\nSummary In this post, we write a simple Go project, generate coverage report, configure SonarScanner, and analyze our project in Sonar. The next part - TBD will be about integrating this project to Jenkins and reject our pipeline based on the project quality report.\nYou can find source code of this project in Github\nResources  \rhttps://docs.sonarqube.org/latest \rhttps://blog.golang.org/cover  ","date":1594506536,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594506536,"objectID":"c89805e0320134c570733a7d8ef4b05b","permalink":"http://cemalonder.com/post/go-sonar-integration-using-docker-part-1/","publishdate":"2020-07-12T01:28:56+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/go-sonar-integration-using-docker-part-1/","section":"post","summary":"In this series, we are going to integrate a Go project with Sonar using Docker.

Even if I agree his article point:\n Don’t be a clean code zealot. Clean code is not a goal. It’s an attempt to make some sense out of the immense complexity of systems we’re dealing with.\n I don\u0026rsquo;t agree how misleading his article title and how not descriptive his example. Because this kind of titles \u0026ldquo;Goodbye Clean Code\u0026rdquo; gives power to another kind of zealots who hates some Software Principles or hates someone around him mentioning this kind of principles. When you title your article like this, it is too easy being used as a power in social medias to be offensive against software principles just by mentioning your article without any arguments to use with your own. Also think about how many people exist who never know Clean Coding principles but using your article just as a weapon against it instead of his own experiences. Rather I like the people who has deep knowledge of Clean Coding and Refactoring and can give some advice where to use them properly and giving me awareness of it (which is probably aim of this article but I find it misleading and insufficient)\nJust for an idea, you can google \u0026ldquo;OOP sucks\u0026rdquo; or ironically \u0026ldquo;Goodbye Redux\u0026rdquo; to see how zealots use this kind of titles where I both like OOP and Redux.\nDan mentions 2 points to give you the awareness beside his title, lets have a look at them:\n Firstly, I didn’t talk to the person who wrote it. I rewrote the code and checked it in without their input. Even if it was an improvement (which I don’t believe anymore), this is a terrible way to go about it\n I think this is the right way you should do when you are truly doing refactoring. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to talk the person directly if you are doing refactoring, you should be in trust with unit tests. And if the code has a little indicators of clean coding than you should have general idea why the code is structured like that or your team must have some documentations for exceptions. What if the person who writes the line leaves the job? You still contact them personally? No, we don\u0026rsquo;t. We make unit \u0026amp; integration tests, properly structure our code with internally documenting (in our code) and finally we may have externally documentation for exceptional cases.\nAnd Dan\u0026rsquo;s second mention:\n For example, we later needed many special cases and behaviors for different handles on different shapes\n When I first read these lines, I say myself \u0026ldquo;finally I will see the point and understand what happened in above code, and satisfied with his argument in title\u0026rdquo;. It did not happen. He gave me lots of lines above which than I was expecting to see some evidence or some real results. But instead I read something like \u0026ldquo;special cases\u0026rdquo; which does not give me the idea.\n What special cases did he need? What should we learn when we refactored like above? Which points we should be more careful? How did your \u0026ldquo;refactorings\u0026rdquo; are merged, any Pull Request? Who is the reviewer, where is the discussion, did your boss call only you?  As I said before, I know his point. But title, arguments he show and how article is being mentioned in twitter, reddit and lots of other social medias is dangerous. If you trust that who uses this article has deep knowledge in software principles, software architectures etc. than we don\u0026rsquo;t have any discussions here. When I start searching if there are some people thinking like me than I see this discussion on reddit and it pleased me that they exist.\nIf Dan wants to say \u0026ldquo;Great power comes with great responsibility\u0026rdquo;, I agree. But it is already mentioned by Stan Lee and can be applied in any area of our live with example real life scenarios. If we know all this kind of principles, we should be careful when \u0026amp; where to apply them. But to get this experience we should first read \u0026amp; get deep knowledge of them, make some mistake and learn from our mistakes. Otherwise it is too easy for people never read refactoring, clean coding, YAGNI, DRY etc. and only mentioning around this kind of articles as an excuse of not knowing this principles.\n","date":1578888878,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578888878,"objectID":"75db7e4f30f3d2e6e3a668fe7776b562","permalink":"http://cemalonder.com/post/welcome-back-clean-code/welcome-back-clean-code/","publishdate":"2020-01-13T07:14:38+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/welcome-back-clean-code/welcome-back-clean-code/","section":"post","summary":"I recently read an article from Dan Abramov who is the creator of Redux.

We can start with explaining those first:\n5-layer Architecture Layering is logical separation that you implement in your application. It has a relation with N-Tier but we will move onto it later:\nPresentation This is how your application is shown to the user. You can think about it is a look and feel of the application. But it is very similar to the UI layer, today\u0026rsquo;s world with the improvement of JavaScript (client-side-rendering solutions like React, Angular, etc.) this separation may not be seem exact but still makes sense, let me continue:\nUI This is where user interactions are interpreted. What happens when user clicks submit button, how the data is sent to the server and retrieved? If you think about server-side rendering which we used older times, we were all interpreting those and returning user fully ready HTML page but today with client-side-rendering all of those works are done in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser with the help of JavaScript. So you can think about now Presentation + UI is done in users server (phone, pc etc.) if client-side-rendering is used. If the user\u0026rsquo;s server is only responsible for showing the data, now the Presentation layer takes place there while UI layer takes place in our server.\nBusiness Logic This is the place where we are responsible for data validation (even if you did it in client-side, we should do in server-side too because we never trust to clients), manipulation, security, processing, database lookups, etc. takes place. Those responsibilities can be shared between UI side and Data Access depending on the action\u0026rsquo;s security scope\nData Access This is where you abstract to insert, delete, etc. actions that you need to do on the DataBase (Data Storage level). It kinda interfaces between DataBases and your application\nData Storage This is were database servers belong. This is the implementation of the Data Access layer which psychically inserts, deletes, etc. data on the server.\n5-Tier Architecture Now depending on your application\u0026rsquo;s needs, you should define your trade-offs:\n What do you want to achieve? How much do you want to scale? What is your acceptable latency?  If you achieve low latency and you don\u0026rsquo;t aim to be used by too many users, you can start with 1-tier. In the below demonstrations keep in mind that the business logic layer can be done in any layers as long as you keep security reasons, you can have some general/simple business logic in client-side (Presentation/UI layers) too which may increase your servers performance. Also, you can put UI layer in higher/lower tiers depend on using server-side or client-side rendering but we talked about general idea above:\n1-tier All layers belong to one physical location. Like a game that installed on the user\u0026rsquo;s database and doesn\u0026rsquo;t request any other external system, it has own database on the user\u0026rsquo;s server and all logics implemented there.\n2-tier Lets say you want to central database management and all other parts can remain still user\u0026rsquo;s server, like hes is playing a game on mobile-phone but data is stored in our servers.\nUp to now, you have a performance advantage. If you need to support more users and need more security than you need scalability.\n3-tier Beside microservices (maybe another discussion topic), this is one of the most used architecture. Presentation and UI is on the user\u0026rsquo;s server (client), business logic and data access belongs to application server, and data storage is in another server.\nBut now your user\u0026rsquo;s request is jumping more tier\u0026rsquo;s which will increase your network latency. As talked before it is about trade-offs. Also now you started to have benefit of scaling like:\nSo depending on your application needs, security levels, latency limits, user counts etc. You can split it up to more tiers which is it the reason why its name is N-Tier.\nReferences   Expert C#2006 Business Objects - Rockford Lhotka\n  Software Architecture Patterns - Mark Richards\n  ","date":1568353077,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568438277,"objectID":"269a413850d15cdf46b50439db61fc28","permalink":"http://cemalonder.com/post/5-layer-and-5-tier-architecture/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T08:37:57+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/5-layer-and-5-tier-architecture/","section":"post","summary":"There are differences between N-layer and N-tier definitions.
